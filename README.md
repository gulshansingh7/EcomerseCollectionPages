 Ecommerce Collection Page

This project creates an interactive e-commerce collection page for a snowboard store. The page fetches product data from an API and displays it in a grid layout with smooth animations. It also includes a filter feature to sort products by price and re-renders the UI with animations.

Features:
 Product Display: Products are fetched from the API and displayed with their image, name, price, and description.
Animations: Products animate in a staggered manner when they are loaded.
Sorting: Users can filter products by price (Low to High or High to Low).
Responsive: The page adapts to different screen sizes, with a flexible grid layout and mobile-friendly design.
